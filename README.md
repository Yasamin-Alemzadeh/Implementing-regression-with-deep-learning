# CO2 Emission Prediction with Neural Network

This project aims to predict CO2 emissions using a neural network implemented with Keras. It utilizes a dataset containing various features related to CO2 emissions. The neural network is trained to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between these features and the corresponding CO2 emissions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- Keras
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

Clone this repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

Install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install keras numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Place your CO2 emission dataset file named `co2.csv` in the project directory.
2. Open the `co2_prediction.py` file.
3. Modify the neural network architecture if needed.
4. Run the script using the following command:

   ````
   python co2_prediction.py
   ```

5. The script will train the neural network and provide the CO2 emission predictions.
6. The training loss plot will be displayed.

## Dataset

The dataset (`co2.csv`) contains the following columns:

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3
- Feature 4
- Feature 5
- CO2 Emission (target variable)

Make sure that your dataset follows this structure.

## Model Architecture

The neural network implemented for this project consists of two dense layers:

1. Input layer with 20 neurons and ReLU activation function.
2. Output layer with 1 neuron.

The model is compiled with the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer.

## Results

The script will output the CO2 emission predictions for the test dataset. Additionally, a plot showing the training loss over epochs will be displayed.
